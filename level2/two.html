        <!-- 
            TASK 1: Basic Flex Container
            Learn about flex, direction, and alignment
            
            WHAT TO MODIFY: The <div> tag below (line 27) - the gray container
            HOW TO IDENTIFY IT: Look for the div with class "bg-gray-200" - it has a light gray background
                                It contains three colored divs (blue, green, purple) inside it
                                Currently has classes: bg-gray-200, p-4, rounded
            WHY THIS TAG: This div is the parent container that needs to become a flex container. 
                          The three colored divs inside are the flex items that need to be arranged horizontally.
                          Without flex, these items would stack vertically (block behavior). Adding flex 
                          will arrange them side by side.
            
            Instructions:  
            1. Add "flex" class to make this a flex container
            2. Add "flex-row" to arrange items horizontally (default)
            3. Add "gap-4" to add space between items

            TASK 2: Flex Direction
            Learn to change flex direction
            
            WHAT TO MODIFY: The <div> tag below (line 50) - the gray container with height
            HOW TO IDENTIFY IT: Look for the div with class "bg-gray-200" and "h-64" - it has a light gray background
                                and a fixed height. It contains three colored divs (red, yellow, orange) inside.
                                Currently has classes: bg-gray-200, p-4, rounded, h-64, flex, flex-col, items-center, justify-center, gap-4
            WHY THIS TAG: This div is already a flex container, but you need to understand how flex-col works.
                          When using flex-col, the main axis becomes vertical, so justify-center centers vertically
                          and items-center centers horizontally (cross-axis). The h-64 gives it height so you can see
                          the vertical centering effect.
            
            Instructions:
            1. Change "flex-row" to "flex-col" to stack items vertically
            2. Add "items-center" to center items horizontally
            3. Add "justify-center" to center items vertically

                    justify-center: Align items to center on main axis (vertical centering when flex-col)
                    h-64: Height of 16rem (256px)

            TASK 3: Justify Content
            Learn to distribute space along main axis
            
            WHAT TO MODIFY: The <div> tag below (line 79) - the gray flex container
            HOW TO IDENTIFY IT: Look for the div with class "bg-gray-200" that contains three divs labeled 
                                "Left", "Center", and "Right". Currently has classes: bg-gray-200, p-4, rounded, flex, flex-row, justify-between
            WHY THIS TAG: This div demonstrates justify-content which controls how items are distributed along 
                          the main axis (horizontal when flex-row). The justify-between class spaces items with 
                          first at start, last at end, and equal space between. This is commonly used for navigation 
                          bars where you want logo on left and links on right.
            
            Instructions:
            1. Try different justify classes:
               - justify-start (default)
               - justify-end
               - justify-center
               - justify-between (space between items)
               - justify-around (space around items)
               - justify-evenly (equal space)
            2. Change to "justify-between" to see space distribution

            TASK 4: Align Items
            Learn to align items on cross axis
            
            WHAT TO MODIFY: The <div> tag below (line 105) - the gray flex container with inline style
            HOW TO IDENTIFY IT: Look for the div with class "bg-gray-200" that has style="height: 150px;"
                                It contains three colored divs (cyan, emerald, violet). Currently has classes: 
                                bg-gray-200, p-4, rounded, flex, flex-row, items-center, gap-4
            WHY THIS TAG: This div demonstrates align-items which controls alignment on the cross-axis (perpendicular 
                          to main axis). When flex-row is used, the cross-axis is vertical, so items-center centers 
                          items vertically. The fixed height (150px) is needed to see the vertical alignment effect.
                          This is essential for vertically centering content in headers and navigation bars.
            
            Instructions:
            1. Add "items-center" to center items vertically
            2. Try "items-start" and "items-end"
            3. Add "items-stretch" to make items fill container height

            TASK 5: Flex Wrap
            Learn to make flex items wrap
            
            WHAT TO MODIFY: The <div> tag below (line 129) - the gray flex container
            HOW TO IDENTIFY IT: Look for the div with class "bg-gray-200" that contains five colored divs 
                                (rose, amber, lime, sky, fuchsia) each with class "w-32". Currently has classes: 
                                bg-gray-200, p-4, rounded, flex, flex-wrap, gap-4
            WHY THIS TAG: This div demonstrates flex-wrap. The child items have fixed width (w-32 = 128px), 
                          so when the container is too narrow, they wrap to the next line. Without flex-wrap, 
                          items would shrink to fit. With flex-wrap, items maintain their size and wrap, which 
                          is essential for responsive card layouts and galleries.
            
            Instructions:
            1. Add "flex-wrap" to allow items to wrap to next line
            2. Try "flex-nowrap" (default) and "flex-wrap-reverse"
            3. Add "gap-4" for spacing

            TASK 6: Create a Navigation Bar
            Combine all flexbox concepts to create a navbar
            
            WHAT TO MODIFY: The <div> tag below (line 163) - the inner div inside bg-gray-800
            HOW TO IDENTIFY IT: Look for the div with class "bg-gray-800" (dark background), then find the inner div
                                that contains "Logo" text and navigation links (Home, About, Contact). 
                                Currently has classes: flex, justify-between, items-center, p-4
            WHY THIS TAG: This div is the main navbar container. It uses flex to create a horizontal layout, 
                          justify-between to push logo to left and nav links to right, and items-center to vertically 
                          center everything. This is the standard pattern for navigation bars. The nested div for links 
                          also uses flex with gap-6 to space the links horizontally.
            
            Instructions:
            1. Create a flex container with:
               - flex
               - justify-between (space between logo and links)
               - items-center (vertical centering)
               - p-4 (padding)
            2. Add a logo div with text
            3. Add a nav links container with:
               - flex
               - gap-6 (space between links)

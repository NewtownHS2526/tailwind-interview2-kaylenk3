        TASK 1: Colors and Backgrounds
        Learn about Tailwind's color system and background utilities
        
        WHAT TO MODIFY: The <div> tag below (line 30)
        HOW TO IDENTIFY IT: Look for the div with class "bg-blue-500" - it has a blue background
        WHY THIS TAG: This div is specifically designed for practicing color changes. 
                      It contains the text "Change my background color to green!" which tells you this is the right element.
        
        Instructions:
        1. Change the background color from "bg-blue-500" to "bg-green-500"
        2. Add a text color class "text-white" to make the text white
        3. Try different color shades: bg-blue-100, bg-blue-300, bg-blue-700, bg-blue-900

            <p class="text-lg">Change my background color to green!</p>
            <!-- 
                bg-blue-500: Background color blue, shade 500 (medium intensity)
                p-6: Padding of 1.5rem (24px) on all sides

            TASK 2: Text Styling
            Learn about text size, weight, and color utilities
            
            WHAT TO MODIFY: The <p> (paragraph) tag below (line 58)
            HOW TO IDENTIFY IT: Look for the paragraph that contains the text "Style this text: Make me bigger, bolder, and purple!"
                                It has classes: text-lg, font-normal, text-gray-700
            WHY THIS TAG: This paragraph is the target element for text styling practice. 
                          The text content explicitly asks you to style it, and it currently has 
                          the base classes (text-lg, font-normal, text-gray-700) that you need to modify.
            
            Instructions:
            1. Change the text size from "text-lg" to "text-2xl"
            2. Change font weight from "font-normal" to "font-bold"
            3. Change text color from "text-gray-700" to "text-purple-600"

            TASK 3: Spacing
            Learn about margin and padding utilities
            
            WHAT TO MODIFY: The inner <div> tag below (line 88) - the yellow one
            HOW TO IDENTIFY IT: Look for the div with class "bg-yellow-200" - it has a yellow background color
                                It also contains the text "Add more spacing to this element!"
                                Currently has classes: bg-yellow-200, p-4, mb-4
            WHY THIS TAG: This div is nested inside the white container and is specifically designed 
                          for spacing practice. It currently has minimal spacing (p-4, mb-4) that you'll expand.
                          The yellow background makes it visually distinct and easy to identify.
            
            Instructions:
            1. Add margin-top of 8 units using "mt-8"
            2. Add padding-left of 12 units using "pl-12"
            3. Change the margin-bottom from "mb-4" to "mb-8"
        -->

                    mb-4: Margin bottom of 1rem (16px)
                    p-4: Padding of 1rem (16px) on all sides
                    Tailwind spacing scale: 1 = 0.25rem (4px), 4 = 1rem (16px), 8 = 2rem (32px)

            TASK 4: Borders and Rounded Corners
            Learn about border and rounded utilities
            
            WHAT TO MODIFY: The inner <div> tag below (line 120) - the pink one
            HOW TO IDENTIFY IT: Look for the div with class "bg-pink-100" - it has a light pink background
                                It contains the text "Add a border and make me more rounded!"
                                Currently has classes: bg-pink-100, rounded, p-6
            WHY THIS TAG: This div is designed specifically for border practice. It currently has 
                          minimal rounding (just "rounded") and no border, which you'll add.
                          The pink background makes it easy to spot, and the text content confirms it's the right element.
            
            Instructions:
            1. Add a border using "border-2 border-red-500"
            2. Make the corners more rounded by changing "rounded" to "rounded-xl"
            3. Add a border color of your choice

                                Currently has classes: bg-indigo-500, text-white, p-8, rounded-xl, mb-4
            WHY THIS TAG: This div is your final challenge - a complete card component. It already has 
                          most of the required classes, so you should verify they're all correct. 
                          This task combines all previous concepts: colors, text styling, spacing, and borders.
                          The indigo background makes it visually distinct from other elements.
            
            Instructions:
            Verify/modify the card div below to ensure it has:
            1. A card div with:
               - Background color: bg-indigo-500
               - Text color: text-white
